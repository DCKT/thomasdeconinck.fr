Recently, I had a specific need on one of [my npm modules](https://gitlab.com/colisweb-open-source/rescript-toolkit) for the mobile app of [Colisweb](https://www.colisweb.com/fr).

The latest version of [rescript-logger](https://github.com/shakacode/rescript-logger) use a GLIB_C version which is not available on our mobile app CI image and I can't change this image, so I didn't had any other choice than downgrade the version.

To do this, I created a npm tag `-mobile` in which I published the supported version with the CI.

## Create a tag

To create a tag, you need to add as suffix the name you want in the `version` field in of your `package.json`. For example :

```json title="package.json"
{
  "version": "2.1.2-mobile"
}
```

When you will publish your module, you will have to specify the tag in the command.

```bash
npm publish --tag mobile
```

## Use the tag

In the project requiring the tag, you can add it by an install command :

```bash
yarn add my-module@mobile
# or
npm i my-module@mobile
```

Or manually in your package.json :

```json title="package.json"
{
  "dependencies": {
    "my-module": "2.1.2-mobile"
  }
}
```
