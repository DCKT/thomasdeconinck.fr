I'm on macOS since more than a decade now, and I always used a tool like [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/)
(before that: [Spectacle](https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle)) for managing my applications
windows and the built-in workspace system of macOS.

Therefore, after many years, I've always be a bit jalous of the tiling experience of Linux, feeling "snappy".
And I take so much time to just make a quick Google search to find this kind of experience for macOS...

## Introducing AeroSpace

And here it is, the alternative I was looking about: [AeroSpace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace).
Some key features :

- Use a tree paradigm for managing the window
- custom emulation of virtual workspaces
- configuration through TOML file

I've been using it on my work laptop for a month now and I could not going back.

### Simple configuration

All is pretty well documented, the default file config has a lot of helpful commands and links to the documentation.

It's pretty straight forward, you bind a set of keymaps to an action like this :

```TOML
alt-1 = 'workspace 1'
alt-2 = 'workspace 2'
```

You can also add shortcuts to run a command line :

```toml
alt-enter = 'exec-and-forget open -n /Applications/WezTerm.app'
```

Switch the window focus through Vim keymap:

```toml
alt-h = 'focus left'
alt-j = 'focus down'
alt-k = 'focus up'
alt-l = 'focus right'
```

### The hardest part: memorization

Like when you start using Vim, you have a lot of shortcuts to learn and remember.

I had the same feeling but by using the features you need, you will force your brain to memorize these shortcuts !
