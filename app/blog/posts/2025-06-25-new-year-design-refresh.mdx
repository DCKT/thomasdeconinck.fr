I think it's a very common thing among developers the urge to update our personal website or environment according our current
feeling.

The "vibe" term feels like appropriate as it's been used A LOT by our IA enjoyers.

I started to learn pixel art pattern, as I always love the concept, the entry cost is lesser than traditional art.
So I've decided to embrace the journey and push the thing on my website.

Also, I tried some HTML5 game engine like [Kaplay](https://kaplayjs.com/), so I can eventualy mix things up !
