This week-end, I ran my first marathon at Charleroi in Belgium !
What a challenge ! I think my preparation was pretty fine but the evelation gain was much too high than I expected.

I had the feeling to go up and down every kilometers. But the killing part was at the 27km with a 6% elevation.
It brokes a lot of people I followed until there.

My goal was 3h45 and had the pleasure to beat it of 1 minute üòÅ !

An other part of my goal was to not walk and keep the pace as long as I can, at the 38-39km **the temptation was hard**.

The thirst, the heat combined with the small pains were a mental fight. I did not resigned but dropped my pace at 6":km until I saw
my family cheering me at the last kilometer boosting myself until the arrival !
