summary: "I decided to improve my typing skills in order to reach 100 words per minutes"
---

Since 8 months, I switched from the azerty keyboard layout for the qwerty.
The main reasons are simple :

- the layout is better for programing
- most of the cool keyboards are sell as qwerty

From there, I did not really practising my typing as far as I would.
I think my average is around 70-80 words per minutes, not bad but not good enough !

## Practise every day with keybr

I discovered the website [keybr](https://www.keybr.com/), which has the particularity of focusing a key and give some
words about it.
This is an excellent way to train the weak part of our fingers.
You can also set a lot settings like the target speed you want etc..

Let's see how far I can improve myself ! Stay tuned üòÅ
