I'm currently reading Hunter x Hunter manga, and the chibi version of Gon made me want to try to draw it
in pixel art. TLDR: drawing a character is far from easy ðŸ˜¬

import Image from "next/image";

<Image src={`/${filename}/Gon.png`} alt="Gon" width={128} height={128} />

The proportion of the head and the body is pretty hard to achieve.
Also the face form looks like too much to an onion...
